The Psychic Game 
The purpose of this game is for players to test their psychic ability. The player can find out if they are psychic by guessing any letter of the alphabet the computer has already chosen at random. If the player chooses correctly, they really are psychic. If the player did not choose correctly, they can try again. The player has 9 tries to guess!  If the player wins, they will receive an alert message, “You've guessed correctly. You really are Psychic!”. If the player loses, they will receive an alert message, “You didn't guess the correct letter. Try again.”
